# CTNES

This is a project to write an NES game, something Iâ€™ve never done before.

There is a series of blog posts at https://www.moria.us/tags/famicom which talk about the development of this game, and in the [nesdev](nesdev) folder there are snapshots of code which correspond to the blog posts.
